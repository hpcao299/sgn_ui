## Design

It provides a visual representation of the user interface, layout, and interactions of the eCommerce website. The design can serve as a reference for implementing the front-end components and styling.

## Migrating to Next.js
Because of low SEO score, this previous ReactJS app had been migrated to Next.js in order to increase availability to users. Also, it was also a case for learning. However, old ReactJS app is still available on Internet.
